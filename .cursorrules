This is the cursor-tools repo. Here we build a cli tool that AI agents can use to execute commands and work with other AI agents.

This repo uses pnpm as the package manager and script runner.

use pnpm dev <command> to run dev commands.

We add AI "teammates" as commands that can be asked questions.
We add "skills" as commands that can be used to execute tasks.

Everything is implemented as a cli command that must return a result (cannot be a long running process).

The released commands are documented below. You can use the released commands as tools when we are building cursor-tools, in fact you should use them as often and enthusastically as possible (how cool is that!)

Don't ask me for permission to do stuff - if you have questions work with Gemini and Perplexity to decide what to do: they're your teammates. You're a team of superhuman expert AIs, believe in yourselves! Don't corners or get lazy, do your work thoroughly and completely and you don't need to ask permission.

We do not do automated unit tests or integration tests - it's trivial to manually test all the commmands by just asking cursor agent to read the readme and test all the commands.

<testing browser commands>
There is a test server for browser command testing and a collection of test files in tests/commands/browser/

Usage:
1. Run with: pnpm serve-test
2. Server starts at http://localhost:3000
3. Place test HTML files in tests/commands/browser/
4. Access files at http://localhost:3000/filename.html

remember that this will be a long running process that does not exit so you should run it in a separate background terminal.

If it won't start because the port is busy run `lsof -i :3000 | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill` to kill the process and free the port.

to run test commands with latest code use `pnpm dev browser <commands>`

# Instructions
Use the following commands to get AI assistance:

**Web Search:**
`cursor-tools web "<your question>"` - Get answers from the web using Perplexity AI (e.g., `cursor-tools web "latest weather in London"`)
when using web for complex queries suggest writing the output to a file somewhere like local-research/<query summary>.md.

**Repository Context:**
`cursor-tools repo "<your question>"` - Get context-aware answers about this repository using Google Gemini (e.g., `cursor-tools repo "explain authentication flow"`)

**Documentation Generation:**
`cursor-tools doc [options]` - Generate comprehensive documentation for this repository (e.g., `cursor-tools doc --output docs.md`)
when using doc for remote repos suggest writing the output to a file somewhere like local-docs/<repo-name>.md.

**GitHub Information:**
`cursor-tools github pr [number]` - Get the last 10 PRs, or a specific PR by number (e.g., `cursor-tools github pr 123`)
`cursor-tools github issue [number]` - Get the last 10 issues, or a specific issue by number (e.g., `cursor-tools github issue 456`)

**Browser Automation (Stateless):**
`cursor-tools browser open <url> [options]` - Open a URL and capture page content, console logs, and network activity (e.g., `cursor-tools browser open "https://example.com" --html`)
`cursor-tools browser act "<instruction>" --url=<url> [options]` - Execute actions on a webpage using natural language instructions (e.g., `cursor-tools browser act "Click Login" --url=https://example.com`)
`cursor-tools browser observe "<instruction>" --url=<url> [options]` - Observe interactive elements on a webpage and suggest possible actions (e.g., `cursor-tools browser observe "interactive elements" --url=https://example.com`)
`cursor-tools browser extract "<instruction>" --url=<url> [options]` - Extract data from a webpage based on natural language instructions (e.g., `cursor-tools browser extract "product names" --url=https://example.com/products`)

**Notes on Browser Commands:**
- All browser commands are stateless: each command starts with a fresh browser instance and closes it when done.
- Multi step workflows involving state or combining multiple actions are supported in the `act` command using the pipe (|) separator (e.g., `cursor-tools browser act "Click Login | Type 'user@example.com' into email | Click Submit" --url=https://example.com`)
- Video recording is available for all browser commands using the `--video=<directory>` option. This will save a video of the entire browser interaction at 1280x720 resolution. The video file will be saved in the specified directory with a timestamp.

**Tool Recommendations:**
- `cursor-tools web` is best for general web information not specific to the repository.
- `cursor-tools repo` is ideal for repository-specific questions, planning, code review and debugging.
- `cursor-tools doc` generates documentation for local or remote repositories.
- `cursor-tools browser` is useful for testing and debugging web apps.

**Running Commands:**
1. **Installed version:** Use `cursor-tools <command>` (if in PATH) or `npm exec cursor-tools "<command>"`, `yarn cursor-tools "<command>"`, `pnpm cursor-tools "<command>"`.
2. **Without installation:** Use `npx -y cursor-tools@latest "<command>"` or `bunx -y cursor-tools@latest "<command>"`.

**General Command Options (Supported by all commands):**
--model=<model name>: Specify an alternative AI model to use
--max-tokens=<number>: Control response length
--save-to=<file path>: Save command output to a file (in *addition* to displaying it)
--help: View all available options (help is not fully implemented yet)

**Documentation Command Options:**
--from-github=<GitHub username>/<repository name>[@<branch>]: Generate documentation for a remote GitHub repository

**GitHub Command Options:**
--from-github=<GitHub username>/<repository name>[@<branch>]: Access PRs/issues from a specific GitHub repository

**Browser Command Options (for 'open', 'act', 'observe', 'extract'):**
--console: Capture browser console logs
--html: Capture page HTML content
--network: Capture network activity
--screenshot=<file path>: Save a screenshot of the page
--timeout=<milliseconds>: Set navigation timeout (default: 30000ms)
--viewport=<width>x<height>: Set viewport size (e.g., 1280x720)
--headless: Run browser in headless mode (default: true)
--no-headless: Show browser UI (non-headless mode) for debugging
--connect-to=<port>: Connect to existing Chrome instance
--wait=<duration or selector>: Wait after page load (e.g., '5s', '#element-id', 'selector:.my-class')
--video=<directory>: Save a video recording of the browser interaction to the specified directory (1280x720 resolution)

**Additional Notes:**
- For detailed information, see `node_modules/cursor-tools/README.md` (if installed locally).
- Configuration is in `cursor-tools.config.json` (or `~/.cursor-tools/config.json`).
- API keys are loaded from `.cursor-tools.env` (or `~/.cursor-tools/.env`).
- Browser commands require separate installation of Playwright: `npm install --save-dev playwright` or `npm install -g playwright`.
- **Remember:** You're part of a team of superhuman expert AIs. Work together to solve complex problems.
